## Context and problem statement

::: content-hidden
State the context and some background on the issue, then write a
statement in the form of a question for the problem.
:::

As part of the design cycle for the Seedcase Project, we do all our
developments in iteration which generally run for about three weeks. At
the end of each iteration, we have a retrospective meeting where we
discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what we can improve.
After having worked with an external consultancy, we have been using
FigJam for our retrospectives. This has been a great tool for us to
collaborate and share our thoughts and ideas. However, we need to make a
decision on whether we should continue using FigJam for our
retrospectives or if we should look for an alternative tool.

## Decision drivers

::: content-hidden
List some reasons for why we need to make this decision and what things
have arisen that impact work.
:::

The decision to look at our retrospective tools was primarily driven by
the fact that the FigJam board we use is hosted by the consultancy
company we worked with at the end of 2023. We have been assured that we
are more than welcome to keep using it, but it is not really a
sustainable solution. We should have a board where we are the owners,
and which can't suddenly disappear because someone decides that former
clients should no longer have access to their accounts. To start with,
we were convinced that we couldn't use the free version of FigJam, so we
started looking for alternatives. We collected information on a variety
of online open access tools, but more importantly, collated a list of
requirements and features that we need for our retrospectives. Towards
the end of this exercise, we found out that we could use the free
version of FigJam, and that it would be easier to continue using it than
to switch to a new tool.

Having done all the work, we decide to write up our results in this
post, so that we can refer back to it in the future, should we at some
point need to revisit our decision. This means that the rest of this
post won't conform to the usual decision post format, but will instead
be a summary of our findings.

## Requirements and features needed for an online retrospective session

The requirements and features we identified as necessary for a good
retrospective session can be divided up into three categories.

The first is the creation of the issues (good, improvable) on virtual
post-its, the second the organisation of these cards, and the third the
overall functionality of the board.

### Cards

The following features are needed for the cards:

-   They should be easy to create, edit, and delete.
-   They should not have a maximum length (or it should be quite long).
-   They should be movable.
-   They should have clear ownership.
-   They should be easy to read.
-   They should be able to have different colours.

We have not assigned a priority to these features at this point in time,
as we expect to continue with the current solution, but should we in
future wish to change then we will need to make a prioritised list.

### Organisation of cards

The following features are needed for the organisation of the cards:

-   It should be easy to group cards.
-   It should be possible to keep groups of cards visually separate.
-   It should be possible to move groups of cards.
-   It should be possible to add comments and actions to cards.
    -   this should be possible to follow on screen for all
        participants.
    -   there should not be a maximum length for comments.
-   It should be easy to convert cards to actions/issues.
-   It should be easy to navigate the board and get a visual overview of
    the cards.

At present we don't see a need to be able to vote on cards, and likewise
there is no need to archive or search for specific cards. This could
change and should not be discarded as possible features for the future.

### Board functionality

The overall functionality of the board and individual sessions should
include the following:

-   It should be possible to save a retrospective session.
    -   this includes a timer function to keep the session on track.
-   It should be possible to archive a session, so that it is easy to
    refer back to it.
-   It should be possible to share the board with all participants.
-   It should be possible to have multiple users on the board at the
    same time.
-   The board should be accessible to all participants at all times.
-   The board should be hosted online, so that it is easy to access from
    anywhere, and not dependent on a specific machine to be running.
-   It would be nice to have a number of fun elements (stickers, emojis,
    etc.) to make the session more engaging.

We don't see a need for audio or chat functionality at present, as we
are using discord for the meeting itself. This could change in the
future, and should not be discarded as possible features for the future.

## Considered options

::: content-hidden
List and describe some of the options, as well as some of the benefits
and drawbacks for each option.
:::

Before deciding on FigJam we investigated a number of other tools. There
is a list of open source retrospective tools available at [Project
Management
Planet](https://www.projectmanagementplanet.com/open-source-retrospectives-tools/),
which we used as a starting point. To see a brief overview of the tools
we looked at, see the original issue on GitHub: [Seedcase Project Team
Issue
184](https://github.com/seedcase-project/team/issues/184#issuecomment-2376838975)

## Decision outcome

We have decided to continue using FigJam for our retrospectives. The
functionality offered in the free version of the product is more than
enough for our needs, and we are happy with the tool. We will continue
to use it until such time as we find that it no longer meets our needs,
or until we find a better tool. This is mainly due to the fact that we
are familiar with the tool, and that we have been able to move our
existing archive of boards to our own account.
