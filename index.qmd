We make decision posts (also known as "Decision Records") that are inspired by [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/). These are structured records describing the reasons for why we choose certain tools, technologies, or processes for our software, our collaboration workflow, and our websites.

All our decisions adhere to our [Guiding Principles](https://seedcase-project.org/about/#guiding-principles).
