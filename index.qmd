We make decision posts (also known as "Decision Records") that are
inspired by [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/).
These are structured records describing the reasons for why we choose
certain tools, technologies, or processes for our software, our
collaboration workflow, and our websites.

All our decisions adhere to our [Guiding
Principles](https://seedcase-project.org/about/#guiding-principles).
