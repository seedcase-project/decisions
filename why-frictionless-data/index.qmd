## Context and problem statement

State the context and some background on the issue, then write a
statement in the form of a question for the problem.

Since the Seedcase Project is focused on improving the structure and infrastructure around data, a critical component of that is how we structure the data and the metadata after enters into Seedcase software.
So, following our [guiding principles](https://seedcase-project.org/about/principles) and to minimize time spent on tasks that already have solutions, we need to find any standards or frameworks that exist for how data and metadata should be structured and organized.
So the question is:

*What standard should we follow when structuring and organizing our data and metadata?*
