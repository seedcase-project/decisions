## Context and problem statement

::: content-hidden
State the context and some background on the issue, then write a
statement in the form of a question for the problem.
:::

Since the Seedcase Project is focused on improving the structure and
infrastructure around data, a critical component of that is how we
structure the data and the metadata after enters into Seedcase software.
So, following our [guiding
principles](https://seedcase-project.org/about/principles) and to
minimize time spent on tasks that already have solutions, we need to
find any standards or frameworks that exist for how data and especially
metadata should be structured and organized. So the question is:

*What standard should we follow when structuring and organizing our data
and metadata?*

## Decision drivers

::: content-hidden
List some reasons for why we need to make this decision and what things
have arisen that impact work.
:::

-   We need a guide that will help us determine how data gets structured
    when it enters into Seedcase software.
-   We want an established standard to follow so that we have better
    interoperability with other tools and systems.
-   We want to reduce time spent on building solutions if one already
    exists to solve the problem we have.
-   We need something that has a Python connector or package, since we
    use Python.

## Considered options

::: content-hidden
List and describe some of the options, as well as some of the benefits
and drawbacks for each option.
:::

There are limited options in this space, especially with our
requirements like being open source and not being commercial solutions.
Some are listed
[here](https://atlan.com/open-source-data-catalog-tools/) and
[here](https://github.com/opendatadiscovery/awesome-data-catalogs). Many
of the tools that exist are strongly focused on corporate needs and on a
providing an extensively featured platform for sharing data and
metadata, without a clear structure to the data or metadata itself.
There are some "data catalog" tools, but many don't fit our
requirements. These are some that exist but that we don't consider, with
reasons given below.

-   [DataHub](https://datahub.io/): Is built with JavaScript and React.
-   [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan): A data catalog tool that is
    largely focused on a way of presenting data/metadata, without
    consideration for how it is structured.
-   [OpenDataDiscovery](https://opendatadiscovery.org/): Requires a
    Docker container to run, mostly focused on commercial needs, and is
    intended as a platform for hosting and sharing (internal) data.
    There is a command-line interface, but there is no easy
    documentation on how to use it, nor is it actively developed.
-   [OpenMetadata](https://docs.open-metadata.org/v1.4.x): Similar to
    OpenDataDiscovery.

The only real open metadata standard that seems to exist is the
[Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) standard.
