title: "Why Markdown"
description: |
    Markup languages are systems for writing plain text in a structured way that
    dictates how it will be displayed. There are many markup languages and this
    post describes our reasons for using Markdown.

## Context and problem statement

Writing documentation is the core of any human activity, be it a set of
instructions, agreements, how-to guides, or even notes. What tools we
use to write documentation can have a significant impact on how we
write, how we collaborate, and how we share information. Following from
our principles, we want open source tools that integrate well with other
tools we use. These tools are called "markup languages". However, there
are many different markup languages to choose from, and we need to
decide which one to use. The question then becomes:

*Which markup language should we use as the basis for writing all types
of documentation across Seedcase activities?*

## Decision drivers

Aside from our principles, additional drivers are:

-   Familiar to a wide range of people.
-   Popular and well-established.
-   Easy to learn and use.
-   Plain-text based.
-   Able to produce output in multiple formats.

## Considered options

While HTML and LaTeX are popular and well-established markup languages,
their main disadvantage is that they cannot output to different formats.
So we don't consider them. The two main options that fit our drivers
are:

-   [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
-   [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)

### Markdown

Markdown, also commonly referred to as
[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), is a lightweight markup language
with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be
converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.
Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in
online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text
editor.

#### Benefits

-   It is by far the most popular markup language used by the widest
    range of people, not just developers.
-   Integrated in nearly all major platforms, like GitHub, WordPress,
    Stack Exchange, many communication tools like Slack.
-   Has the massive advantage of having a powerful format converter
    called [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
-   Many tools and libraries that use and support it, such as [R
    Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Jupyter
    Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
-   It is very easy to use and learn, with a simple syntax that is
    intuitive and easy to remember. Even non-technical people can start
    using it within minutes.

#### Drawbacks

-   There are many different versions of Markdown, though there are
    strong efforts to standardize it onto CommonMark.
-   Because of it's ease of use, there are some more powerful features
    that are not implemented in the original Markdown syntax, so
    extensions are needed to use features that may be needed in some
    cases.

### reStructuredText

reStructuredText is a format used for writing technical documentation,
it's popularly is largely due to it being the default format for
documentation in Python projects and packages. Like Markdown, it is
plain text, fairly simple to use.

::::: columns
::: column
#### Benefits

-   Because it is the default for Python documentation, it's use and
    support is widely available in the Python community.
-   It is more powerful than Markdown, with more features built in
    mainly because it was designed for technical writing in mind.
:::

::: column
#### Drawbacks

-   Not nearly as widely used as Markdown.
-   Is a bit more difficult to learn and to read, at least relative to
    Markdown.
-   While Pandoc can convert it to many formats, because Markdown is the
    core to Pandoc, it can't convert many of its features into the other
    formats, which minimises it's benefit of being more powerful.

## Decision outcome

We decided on **Markdown** because it is the most popular and widely
used markup language, it is easy to learn and use, and it has a powerful
format converter in Pandoc. We also use [Quarto](/why-quarto/index.qmd)
for creating websites and other output, which is built on top of
Pandoc's Markdown. Through Quarto we have access to many powerful
features that make up for Markdown's less powerful features.

### Consequences

-   We don't foresee any major consequences to this decision.
